# ![Mod Retexture](https://i.imgur.com/kcEFiWW.png)

This mod retextures seeds, starters, and saplings from over fifteen different mods into uniform sleeves, satchels, stashes, and sacks. Enhance your farming experience with visually unified inventory!

Choose from sensible designs or seasonal variations, with intuitive icons for trellis and bush seeds indicating which plants cannot be walked through. Customizable options include various configurable categories that can be toggled on and off at will.
